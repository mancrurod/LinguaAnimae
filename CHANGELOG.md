## [0.6.0] - 2025-05-23

### Added
- Cross-validation pipeline (`k-fold`) for robust evaluation of emotion classifier, using HuggingFace Trainer + StratifiedKFold.
- Final fine-tuning script on the entire dataset with support for balanced training (optional oversampling).
- Automated script to extract 1000 unique random verses for labeling, with duplicate filtering based on verse_id and batch/version tracking.
- Data cleaning utilities for emotion label remapping, removal of ambiguous classes, and mapping to canonical emotion set.
- Export and visualization tools for classification reports and confusion matrices after fine-tuning.
- Metrics saving for each experiment (per fold and final training).
- Early stopping in all Trainer workflows for more efficient training and less overfitting.

### Changed
- Emotion and theme mapping dictionaries (`EMOTION_MAP`, `THEME_MAP`) updated to reflect the actual output labels of models and data.
- Refactored training and evaluation scripts: now support both cross-validation and standard train/test split from a single pipeline.
- All oversampling/balance code is now optional and controlled by a single block, to be used only when needed.
- Improved sampling and labeling scripts to avoid duplicated verses and track labeled batches by iteration.
- Updated documentation and inline comments in all fine-tuning and evaluation scripts.

### Fixed
- Fixed bugs where duplicated verses could be re-sampled and sent for labeling in subsequent rounds.
- Corrected emotion label mismatches caused by model/corpus discrepancies in emotion mapping.
- Improved error handling and logging during data loading and label validation steps.

## [0.5.1] - 2025-05-16

### Changed
- Refactored `app.py` into modular functions (e.g. `render_language_selector`, `render_user_inputs`, `analyze_user_input`, `render_analysis_results`, etc.) for improved readability and maintainability.
- Moved all global styles and background logic to `set_background()` and `inject_custom_styles()`.
- Normalized Spanish book names in verse references via `BOOK_NAME_MAP_ES`, ensuring accents and numbers are properly rendered (e.g. `1 Pedro`, `IsaÃ­as`, `JeremÃ­as`).
- Updated `render_analysis_results()` to dynamically map book identifiers using `BOOK_NAME_MAP_ES` (Spanish) or title-cased formatting (English).

## [0.5.0] - 2025-05-09

### Added
- `save_feedback_to_gsheet.py`: Sends user feedback (like/dislike) to a Google Sheet using a service account.
- Feedback buttons with emoji now animate on hover and are centered for improved UX.
- Confirmation message after sending a message via text input (`âœ… Message sent successfully!`), localized.
- Font styling applied to emotion and theme blocks for typographic consistency (`Merriweather`).
- Tooltip-ready button structure using inline HTML and accessible styles.

### Changed
- Feedback block redesigned with custom HTML/CSS: more compact, centered, and responsive.
- Translated text ("Texto traducido automÃ¡ticamente") and subtitle now centered via inline styles.
- Switched to Enter-to-Submit flow for text input instead of a separate submit button, aligning with standard UX expectations.
- Updated `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt` to include dependencies for Google Sheets integration and local development.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-05-09

### Added
- `render_theme.py`: Visual component matching the emotion renderer, with color, icon and multilingual support.
- Theme and emotion block rendering fully integrated into `app.py` with consistent style and accessibility.
- `recommender.py`: Support for corpus selection based on interface language (`bible_kjv` or `bible_rv60`).
- Label translation logic in recommendation filtering via `EMOTION_MAP` and `THEME_MAP` to ensure Spanish corpus compatibility.

### Changed
- Streamlit accessibility warnings resolved by setting `label_visibility="collapsed"` on empty labels.
- Improved `load_corpus()` to load from the appropriate directory depending on the current language.
- `recommend_verses()` now supports dynamic filtering by language and auto-translation of query labels.
- Updated `05_evaluation.ipynb` with a final summary and refined conclusions based on model performance and cross-lingual alignment.

### Fixed
- Prevented `KeyError` in `render_theme_block()` when receiving already-translated labels.
- Ensured consistent theme rendering regardless of input language.
- Fixed mismatch between label language and corpus filtering logic that prevented Spanish recommendations from working.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-05-01

### Added
- `labeling_pipeline.py`: Unified emotion + theme classification runner with CLI support, GPU detection, logging, and skip flags.
- `emotion_theme_labeling.py` and `theme_labeling.py`: Modular labelers supporting HuggingFace pipelines and batch GPU processing.
- `translate_and_apply_labels.py`: Maps English-labeled files into Spanish using custom theme/emotion translations and merges with `bible_rv60`.
- `04_translate_labels.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating cross-language label alignment.
- `05_evaluation.ipynb`: Validates Spanish label quality against English annotations using exact match and theme overlap metrics.
- Per-file runtime logging to `logs/labeling_logs/` with timestamps and total summaries.

### Changed
- Folder structure aligned: `data/labeled/<bible_name>/emotion/` and `emotion_theme/` created per Bible version.
- Replaced deprecated `annotated/` folder with `labeled/`.
- All labeling scripts updated to write `_emotion.csv` and `_emotion_theme.csv` outputs.
- Git commit logic standardized using conventional commits + emoji tags.
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude `__init__.py` files by default.

### Documentation
- Docstrings and inline comments added to all labeling and translation scripts for clarity.
- Expanded README instructions for GPU setup and script execution.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-04-25
### Changed
- `bible_scraper.py` now automatically extracts all books and chapters from the Reina-Valera 1960 Bible.
- Outputs structured CSV files named `<index>_<book>.csv`.
- Implemented error logging system into `logs/` with timestamped error logs.
- Improved scraping logic for robustness against missing or broken chapters.

---

## [0.1.0] - 2025-04-21
### Added
- Initial project structure: `data/`, `src/`, `notebooks/`, `tests/`.
- `bible_scraper.py` to extract the Gospel of John (RV60) from biblia.es.
- CSV output format including chapter, verse, subtitle, text, and source_url.
- `01_scraping_exploration.ipynb` for data validation and visualization.
- Custom README with Conda and pip instructions.
- Basic project metadata for GitHub setup.

## [Unreleased]
### Planned
- Streamlit app with a chatbot interface to retrieve Bible verses aligned with user input.
  - Input: free-form user prompt
  - Output: verses ranked by emotion, theme, and semantic similarity
- Multilingual support: English and Spanish queries using labeled corpora (`bible_kjv`, `bible_rv60`)
- Vector search integration using embeddings from sentence-transformers or HuggingFace models
- DuckDB or SQLite integration for fast, local verse retrieval
- Session-based logging to capture feedback and suggested improvements
